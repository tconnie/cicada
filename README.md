# Cicada Species Detection Based on Acoustic Signals
Cicada Species Recognition Based on Acoustic Signals

## Introduction
In recent years, the 17-year periodical cicada species that only emerge once every 17 years have found to emerge earlier than expected. Scientists believe that this change may be due to climate change that has disrupted the internal clocks of the species. However, there is not enough data to affirm this hypothesis as the species only emerges once in two decades. Thus, this paper proposes to develop a cicada species recognition system using their acoustic signals to monitor the cicada species. This paper aims to aid in the study of relationships between the behavioural changes of cicada species and the environment. Experiments were carried out using the sound recordings of cicada species collected from different online sources. The audio dataset was pre-processed by denoising and applied audio segmentation before visualized as spectrogram images. The model developed for training and classification was convolutional neural network (CNN) and the results of the experiments achieved a high accuracy.
